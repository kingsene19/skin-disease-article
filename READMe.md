### Efficient Combination of Deep Learning models for skin disease classification

Classification of skin disorders using an image is a challenging task that relies heavily on the characteristics of particular diseases to accurately classify the disease. But most skin diseases show similar characteristics in visual perspective, making it difficult to select essential image features. Accurate analysis of skin diseases from image is necessary to improve diagnosis and also speeds up diagnosis time. This would further enable improved and cost-effective treatment for affected patients.<br/>
This repository contains the code for the paper *Efficient Combination of Deep Learning models for skin disease classification*  presented at CNRIA 2024. It consists of:
- Skin disease classification approach using Attention U-Net for segmentation and customized CNN for classification
- Improved classification performance through preprocessing methods like data augmentation, oversampling, and hyperparameter optimization.
- High accuracy and F1 scores achieved on HAM10000 dataset (99% and 98.7% respectively).
- Results competitive with other state-of-the-art models.
